# a="Rohan Kumar";
# print(a[3:7]);

# b = "Hello, World!"
# print(b[:5])



# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.upper())


# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.lower())

# The strip() method removes any whitespace from the beginning or the end:
# a = " Hello, World! "
# print(a.strip())

# The replace() method replaces a string with another string:
# a = "Hello, WorlH!"
# print(a.replace("H", "J"))

# The split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator:
#  a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.split(",")) # returns ['Hello', ' World!']


# Use the format() method to insert numbers into strings:

# age = 36
# txt = "My name is John, and I am {}"
# print(txt.format(age))


txt = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north."
print(txt);
